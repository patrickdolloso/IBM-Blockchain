# What is Blockchain?
* Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.
* One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.
* The videos in this module describe: the business context of blockchain, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works.

## The business context of blockchain
### Business networks, wealth and markets

* **Business Networks** benefit from connectivity
    * Participants are customers, suppliers, banks, partners
    * Cross geography and regulatory boundary
* **Wealth** is generated by the flow of goods and services across business network in transactions and contracts
* **Markets** are central to this process:
    * Public (fruit market, car auction) or
    * Private (supply chain financing, bonds)

### Transferring **assets** building value
#### **Asset** is anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value
* 2 fundamental types of assets
    * Tangiable, e.g. a house
    * Intangible, e.g. a mortgage
* Intangiable assets subdivide
    * Financial, e.g. bond
    * Intellectual e.g. patents
    * Digital e.g. data
* Cash is also an asset
    * Has property of anonymity

### Ledgers, Transactions and Contracts
* Ledger: an important log of all transactions
    * Describes the inputs and outputs of the business
* Transaction: an **asset transfer** between participants
    * Matt gives car to Dave (simple)
* Contract: the **conditions** for a transaction to occur
    * If Dave pays Matt money, then the car passes from Matt to Dave (simple)
    * If car won't start, funds do not pass to Matt (as decided by third party arbitrator) (more complex)
* Blockchain: shared, replicated ledger, smart contracts
* **Problem:** inefficient, expensive, vunerable
* A shared, replicated, permissioned ledger with consensus, povenance, immutability and finality

### Different types of blockchain
* All blocchains aim to provide irrefutable proof that a set of transactions occured between participants
* Different types of blockchain exist:
* Bitcoin is an example of an unpermissioned, public blockchain
* The first blockchain application
* Defines a shadow-currency and its ledger
* Resource intensive
* Blockchains for business genrally prioritize
    * assets over cryptocurrency, identity over anonymity, selective endorsement over proof of work

### Requirements of blockchain for business
* **Assets:** participants ddecide which assets to share
* **Identity:** participants know who they are dealing with, information shared is need-to-know
* **Endorsement:** participants give provable endorsement

### Summary
* Consider the way businesses operate:
- Business networks, assets, transactions contracts, ledgers
- **Ledgers** and **Contracts** are prone to disputes
* Blockchain is a shared, replicated ledger with smart contracts
* All blockchains provide cryptographic proof of transactions
    * Differnt blockchains have different characteristics (e.g. prioritizing privacy over anonymity)
